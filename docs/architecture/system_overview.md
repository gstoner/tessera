# Tessera System Overview

Tessera is a next-generation deep learning programming model built on MLIR infrastructure.

## Core Principles

1. **Shape Polymorphism** - Dynamic shapes with compile-time optimization
2. **Memory Efficiency** - O(N) attention instead of O(N²)  
3. **Hardware Optimization** - Automatic tuning for modern accelerators
4. **Numerical Stability** - Built-in precision policies

## Multi-Level IR Pipeline

```
Python API → Graph IR → Schedule IR → Target IR → GPU Kernels
```

Each level provides different abstractions and optimization opportunities.

## Key Components

- **Graph IR**: High-level mathematical operations
- **Schedule IR**: Execution planning and resource allocation
- **Target IR**: Hardware-specific optimizations
- **Runtime**: Efficient execution engine

This architecture enables both ease of use and maximum performance.
