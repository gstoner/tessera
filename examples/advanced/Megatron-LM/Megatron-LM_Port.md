#Megatron-LM 

Plan to rewrite Megatron-LM to leverage the Tessera programming model. 

# Core Migration Strategy
Incremental Transformation: Rather than a complete rewrite, the plan uses a phased approach that preserves Megatron's proven distributed training patterns while progressively replacing components with Tessera-optimized versions.
- Compatibility-First: The migration maintains API compatibility through bridge layers, allowing existing Megatron users to adopt Tessera benefits without major code changes.
- Performance-Driven: Every phase focuses on measurable performance improvements - targeting 4-6x speedups and 40%+ memory reductions.

# Key Technical Innovations

## Automatic Kernel Selection: Tessera automatically chooses optimal implementations (Flash Attention v3, MLA, Ring Attention) based on hardware and problem characteristics.

- Mesh Tensor Abstractions: Replaces Megatron's manual parallelism coordination with declarative mesh specifications that handle sharding, communication, and load balancing automatically.
- Advanced Attention Mechanisms: Native support for cutting-edge techniques like Multi-Latent Attention (93.3% KV cache reduction) and hardware-specific optimizations for Blackwell B200.
- Compiler-Driven Optimization: Leverages Tessera's multi-level IR stack for automatic fusion, memory optimization, and hardware-specific code generation.

# Business Value Proposition

- Massive Performance Gains: 4-6x training speedup with 40% memory reduction
- Developer Productivity: Automatic optimization eliminates manual kernel tuning
- Hardware Future-Proofing: Single codebase works across H100, B200, MI300X
- Reduced Engineering Overhead: Built-in debugging, profiling, and fault tolerance
