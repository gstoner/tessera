# PDDL-Instruct for Tessera Programming Model - Document 3: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

This document explores how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can be systematically applied within the PDDL-Instruct framework for Tessera kernel generation. We demonstrate structured reasoning processes that lead from high-level kernel requirements to optimized implementations through formal logical steps.

## Overview of Chain-of-Thought for Kernel Generation

Chain-of-Thought reasoning in the context of Tessera kernel generation involves:

1. **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking complex kernels into manageable subproblems
2. **Constraint Analysis**: Systematic evaluation of resource and performance constraints  
3. **Solution Space Exploration**: Guided search through implementation alternatives
4. **Optimization Reasoning**: Logical derivation of performance improvements
5. **Verification Steps**: Formal validation of generated solutions

The PDDL-Instruct framework provides the formal foundation for expressing these reasoning chains.

## Fundamental Reasoning Patterns

### 3.1 Resource-Constrained Reasoning

The most fundamental pattern involves reasoning about GPU resource limitations:

```
CoT Pattern: Memory Hierarchy Optimization

Step 1: Identify Memory Requirements
- Input: Tensor shapes and data types
- Analysis: Calculate total memory footprint
- Constraint: Must fit within available memory tiers

Step 2: Evaluate Memory Tier Options  
- Global Memory: High capacity, low bandwidth, high latency
- Shared Memory: Medium capacity, high bandwidth, low latency  
- Register Memory: Low capacity, highest bandwidth, lowest latency

Step 3: Determine Optimal Placement Strategy
- Large tensors → Global memory with coalesced access
- Reused data blocks → Shared memory with conflict avoidance
- Scalar accumulators → Register memory with minimal spilling

Step 4: Validate Against Constraints
- Check total shared memory usage < 228KB (Hopper)
- Verify register pressure < 255 per thread
- Ensure occupancy targets are met
```

### 3.2 Performance-Driven Reasoning

Performance optimization requires systematic evaluation of implementation alternatives:

```
CoT Pattern: Compute Unit Selection

Step 1: Characterize Computational Workload
- Operation type: Matrix multiplication, elementwise, reduction
- Data precision: FP32, FP16, BF16, FP8, INT8
- Problem size: Small, medium, large scale

Step 2: Evaluate Available Compute Units
- CUDA Cores: General purpose, all precisions, moderate throughput
- Tensor Cores (WMMA): Matrix ops, limited precisions, high throughput
- Tensor Cores (WGMMA): Large matrices, latest precisions, highest throughput

Step 3: Apply Selection Criteria
IF operation is matrix multiplication AND 
   problem size >= 64x64x64 AND
   precision in {FP16, BF16, FP8}
THEN prefer Tensor Cores
ELSE use CUDA Cores

Step 4: Optimize for Selected Units
- Tensor Cores: Optimize tile sizes for WMMA/WGMMA shapes
- CUDA Cores: Maximize vectorization and pipeline utilization
```

## Complex Reasoning Chains

### 3.3 Flash Attention Generation Reasoning

Let's trace a complete reasoning chain for generating Flash Attention:

```
CoT Chain: Flash Attention Kernel Generation

GIVEN: 
- Sequence length S = 2048
- Head dimension D = 128  
- Number of heads H = 32
- Precision: BF16 storage, FP32 accumulation
- Target: Hopper H100 architecture

STEP 1: Problem Analysis
Reasoning: Standard attention requires O(S²) memory for attention matrix
Calculation: 2048² × BF16 = 8MB per head × 32 heads = 256MB
Constraint: Exceeds H100 HBM capacity for large batch sizes
Conclusion: Memory-efficient algorithm required → Flash Attention

STEP 2: Algorithm Selection  
Reasoning: Flash Attention uses online softmax to avoid materializing full attention matrix
Requirements: Tile-based computation, incremental softmax updates
Implementation strategy: Block-wise processing with recomputation

STEP 3: Tiling Strategy
Memory constraint: Shared memory = 228KB on H100
Tensor allocation:
- Q tile: TILE_M × D × BF16
- K tile: TILE_N × D × BF16  
- V tile: TILE_N × D × BF16
Total: (TILE_M + 2×TILE_N) × D × 2 bytes

Calculation for TILE_M=128, TILE_N=128, D=128:
(128 + 2×128) × 128 × 2 = 98,304 bytes = 96KB
Conclusion: Tiling strategy fits within shared memory

STEP 4: Numerical Stability Analysis
Challenge: Online softmax can suffer from numerical overflow/underflow
Solution: Implement numerically stable online softmax with running maximum
Algorithm: 
- Track running maximum m_i across blocks
- Use correction factors α and β for numerical stability
- Accumulate outputs with proper scaling

STEP 5: Compute Unit Optimization
Matrix operations: Q@K^T and P@V  
Shapes: [TILE_M, D] × [D, TILE_N] and [TILE_M, TILE_N] × [TILE_N, D]
Decision: Use WGMMA for 64×256×32 operations
Benefit: 4× throughput improvement over WMMA

STEP 6: Memory Access Optimization
Access patterns:
- Q: Sequential block access (good locality)
- K,V: Repeated access across Q blocks (cache in shared memory)
- Output: Sequential write (coalesced access)
Strategy: Use TMA for bulk transfers, double buffering for overlap

STEP 7: Parallelization Strategy
Thread block configuration: 128 threads (4 warps)
Work distribution: Each warp handles TILE_M/4 = 32 rows
Synchronization: Barriers after shared memory loads
Cluster mode: Use 2×2 cluster for larger problems

STEP 8: Validation and Optimization
Performance target: >800 TFLOPS on H100
Memory efficiency: >80% of peak bandwidth utilization
Numerical accuracy: Error < 1e-6 relative to FP32 reference
Verification: Generate test cases and validate against reference implementation
```

### 3.4 Mixed Precision Reasoning

Mixed precision optimization requires careful balance between performance and accuracy:

```
CoT Chain: Mixed Precision Optimization

PROBLEM: Optimize GEMM kernel with mixed precision for maximum performance

STEP 1: Precision Impact Analysis
Storage precision options: FP32, FP16, BF16, FP8
Accumulation precision options: FP32, FP16  
Trade-offs:
- Lower storage precision → Higher memory bandwidth, potential accuracy loss
- Lower accumulation precision → Higher compute throughput, numerical instability

STEP 2: Numerical Stability Assessment
FP8 storage risks:
- Limited dynamic range: [-240, 240] for E4M3
- Quantization error accumulation in iterative operations
- Gradient underflow in training scenarios

Mitigation strategies:
- Use FP32 accumulation for stability
- Implement loss scaling for gradient preservation  
- Add overflow/underflow detection

STEP 3: Performance Benefit Quantification
Hopper WGMMA throughput (TFLOPS):
- FP8 input, FP32 accumulate: 1320 TFLOPS
- FP16 input, FP32 accumulate: 660 TFLOPS  
- FP32 input, FP32 accumulate: 83 TFLOPS

Memory bandwidth savings:
- FP8: 4× reduction vs FP32
- FP16: 2× reduction vs FP32

STEP 4: Application-Specific Decision
Training scenario:
- Forward pass: FP8 storage, FP32 accumulation
- Backward pass: FP16 storage, FP32 accumulation (gradient precision critical)
- Master weights: FP32 storage

Inference scenario:  
- Aggressive: FP8 storage, FP16 accumulation
- Conservative: FP16 storage, FP32 accumulation

STEP 5: Implementation Strategy
Conversion points:

- Store: Convert FP32 → target precision with rounding

Hardware utilization:
- Use Tensor Core mixed precision modes
- Leverage format conversion units
- Pipeline conversions with computation
```

## Domain-Specific Reasoning Patterns

### 3.5 Convolution Kernel Reasoning

Convolution operations have unique optimization patterns:

```
CoT Pattern: 2D Convolution Optimization

INPUT ANALYSIS:
- Input tensor: [N, C, H, W] = [32, 256, 56, 56] 
- Filter tensor: [K, C, R, S] = [512, 256, 3, 3]
- Output tensor: [N, K, P, Q] = [32, 512, 56, 56]

STEP 1: Algorithm Selection
Options:
- Direct convolution: Simple but inefficient for large filters
- Im2col + GEMM: Transforms convolution to matrix multiplication
- Winograd: Reduces arithmetic complexity for small filters
- FFT-based: Efficient for large filters

Analysis:
- Filter size 3×3: Moderate size, Winograd applicable
- Channel count 256: High, favor GEMM-based approaches
- Input/output size 56×56: Medium size, memory bandwidth critical

Decision: Im2col + GEMM for this configuration
Reasoning: Leverages optimized GEMM kernels, good for high channel counts

STEP 2: Tiling Strategy
GEMM dimensions after Im2col:
- M = N × P × Q = 32 × 56 × 56 = 100,352
- N = K = 512  
- K = C × R × S = 256 × 3 × 3 = 2,304

Tile sizes for WGMMA m64n256k32:
- Need K dimension divisible by 32: 2,304 = 72 × 32 ✓
- M dimension: Use TILE_M = 128 for good occupancy
- N dimension: TILE_N = 256 matches WGMMA native size

STEP 3: Memory Layout Optimization
Im2col transformation:
- Input: NCHW → [M, K] where each row contains filter-sized patches
- Weights: [K, C, R, S] → [K, C×R×S] = [512, 2304]
- Challenge: Im2col creates large temporary tensor

Optimization: Implicit im2col
- Avoid materializing full im2col tensor
- Compute im2col on-the-fly during GEMM
- Use shared memory for patch extraction

STEP 4: Data Movement Analysis
Input data reuse pattern:
- Each input pixel used in R×S = 9 output computations
- Spatial locality: Adjacent outputs share input pixels
- Channel locality: All channels accessed together

Strategy:
- Cache input patches in shared memory
- Use async copy for prefetching next patches
- Minimize redundant global memory accesses

STEP 5: Thread Block Configuration
Workload distribution:
- Each thread block handles TILE_M × TILE_N output elements
- Thread block size: 256 threads (8 warps) for good occupancy
- Each warp handles 32 output elements

Shared memory requirements:
- Input patch cache: TILE_M × C × R × S × sizeof(dtype)
- Weight cache: TILE_N × C × R × S × sizeof(dtype)
- Total for FP16: (128 + 256) × 256 × 9 × 2 = 1.77MB > 228KB

Memory optimization:
- Use smaller tiles or streaming approach
- Pipeline weight loads across K dimension
- Revised: TILE_M=64, streaming K dimension
```

### 3.6 Reduction Operation Reasoning

Reduction operations require careful consideration of parallelization strategies:

```
CoT Pattern: Large-Scale Reduction Optimization

PROBLEM: Sum reduction over tensor [B, S, D] = [32, 8192, 4096]

STEP 1: Reduction Strategy Analysis
Total elements: 32 × 8192 × 4096 = 1,073,741,824 elements
Reduction dimensions: Sum over S and D, keep B

Options:
1. Single-pass reduction: All elements → single thread block
2. Multi-pass reduction: Hierarchical reduction across thread blocks  
3. Warp-cooperative reduction: Use warp primitives for efficiency

Constraint analysis:
- Single-pass: Requires 1B elements in shared memory - impossible
- Multi-pass: Manageable memory, requires global memory synchronization
- Decision: Multi-pass with warp-cooperative primitives

STEP 2: Hierarchical Decomposition  
Level 1: Thread-level reduction
- Each thread reduces ELEMENTS_PER_THREAD elements
- Use loop unrolling for efficiency
- Accumulate in registers

Level 2: Warp-level reduction
- Use shuffle operations for warp-wide reduction
- 32 threads → 1 result per warp
- No shared memory required

Level 3: Block-level reduction  
- Use shared memory for inter-warp reduction
- 8 warps → 1 result per block
- Requires barrier synchronization

Level 4: Grid-level reduction
- Global memory for inter-block communication
- Atomic operations or separate kernel launch
- Final result accumulation

STEP 3: Numerical Stability Considerations
Accumulation order affects numerical accuracy:
- Simple summation: Accumulation errors compound
- Kahan summation: Compensated summation reduces error
- Pairwise summation: Tree-based reduction improves stability

Decision: Use Kahan summation at thread level, pairwise at higher levels
Reasoning: Balance between accuracy and performance

STEP 4: Memory Access Optimization
Access pattern: Sequential reading of input tensor
Optimization strategies:
- Coalesced memory access: Thread i reads element i, i+blockDim, i+2*blockDim...
- Vectorized loads: Use vector types (float4) where possible
- Prefetching: Overlap computation with memory transfers

STEP 5: Launch Configuration
Thread block configuration:
- Block size: 256 threads for good occupancy
- Grid size: Determined by reduction tree depth
- Elements per thread: Balance work distribution and memory usage

Calculation:
- Total elements: 1,073,741,824
- Elements per thread: 4,096 (good for cache locality)  
- Required threads: 262,144
- Thread blocks: 1,024 (256 threads each)
- Grid dimensions: (32, 32, 1) - 2D grid for better resource utilization
```

## Advanced Reasoning Techniques

### 3.7 Multi-Objective Optimization Reasoning

Real kernel optimization involves balancing multiple competing objectives:

```
CoT Chain: Multi-Objective GEMM Optimization

OBJECTIVES:
1. Maximize throughput (TFLOPS)
2. Minimize memory usage  
3. Minimize energy consumption
4. Maintain numerical accuracy

STEP 1: Objective Quantification
Throughput: f₁(config) = achieved_TFLOPS / peak_TFLOPS
Memory efficiency: f₂(config) = 1 - (memory_used / memory_available)  
Energy efficiency: f₃(config) = peak_energy / actual_energy
Numerical accuracy: f₄(config) = 1 - (error / acceptable_error)

STEP 2: Trade-off Analysis
Throughput vs Memory:
- Larger tiles → Higher throughput, more memory usage
- Smaller tiles → Lower throughput, less memory usage

Throughput vs Energy:
- Higher frequencies → More throughput, higher energy
- Lower precision → More throughput, potentially higher energy

Throughput vs Accuracy:
- Lower precision → Higher throughput, lower accuracy
- Aggressive optimizations → Higher throughput, potential accuracy loss

STEP 3: Pareto Frontier Exploration
Configuration space:
- Tile sizes: {64×64, 128×128, 256×256}
- Precisions: {FP32, FP16, BF16, FP8}
- Thread block sizes: {128, 256, 512}

Evaluation method:
FOR each configuration c IN configuration_space:
    evaluate f₁(c), f₂(c), f₃(c), f₄(c)
    IF no other configuration dominates c:
        add c to Pareto frontier

STEP 4: Application-Specific Selection
Training scenario:
- Priority: Accuracy > Throughput > Energy > Memory
- Selection: Conservative precision, moderate tile sizes

Inference scenario:
- Priority: Throughput > Energy > Memory > Accuracy  
- Selection: Aggressive precision, large tiles

STEP 5: Constraint Satisfaction
Hard constraints:
- Memory usage ≤ available memory
- Numerical error ≤ acceptable threshold
- Energy consumption ≤ power budget

Soft constraints (preferences):
- Prefer higher throughput
- Prefer lower energy consumption
- Prefer simpler implementation

Solution: Weighted constraint satisfaction with penalty functions
```

### 3.8 Architecture-Adaptive Reasoning

Different GPU architectures require adaptive reasoning:

```
CoT Pattern: Architecture-Adaptive Kernel Generation

INPUT: Kernel specification + Target architecture

STEP 1: Architecture Capability Assessment
Hopper (H100):
- Tensor cores: WGMMA with large tile sizes
- Memory: TMA for bulk transfers, 228KB shared memory

    leverage async copy for pipelining
    consider sparsity acceleration
ELSE: # Turing or older
    use WMMA where available
    rely on standard memory operations
    focus on occupancy optimization

STEP 3: Memory Hierarchy Adaptation
Shared memory allocation:
- Hopper: Can use up to 228KB, enable dynamic allocation
- Ampere: Limited to 164KB, more conservative allocation
- Turing: Limited to 64KB, minimal shared memory usage

Memory access patterns:
- All architectures: Prioritize coalesced access
- Ampere+: Use async copy for hiding latency
- Hopper: Leverage TMA for maximum bandwidth

STEP 4: Compute Unit Selection
Matrix operations:
- Hopper: WGMMA m64n256k32, m128n256k32 for large matrices
- Ampere: WMMA m16n16k16, m32n8k16 based on problem size  
- Turing: WMMA m16n16k16, fallback to CUDA cores

Precision selection:
- Hopper: Aggressive mixed precision (FP8, FP6)  
- Ampere: Conservative mixed precision (FP16, BF16)
- Turing: Standard precision (FP16, FP32)

STEP 5: Code Generation Adaptation
Instruction selection:
- Use architecture-specific intrinsics

- Optimize for architecture-specific pipeline depths

Launch configuration:
- Adapt block sizes to architecture capabilities
- Consider SM count and occupancy characteristics
- Balance resource usage with architectural limits
```

## Error Handling and Recovery Reasoning

### 3.9 Robustness Reasoning

Kernels must handle edge cases and error conditions:

```
CoT Pattern: Robust Kernel Design

STEP 1: Failure Mode Analysis
Potential failures:
1. Resource exhaustion (memory, registers)
2. Numerical instabilities (overflow, underflow, NaN)
3. Invalid input parameters (negative sizes, null pointers)
4. Hardware limitations (insufficient compute capability)

STEP 2: Prevention Strategies
Resource management:
- Static analysis: Compute resource requirements at compile time
- Dynamic checks: Verify available resources at runtime
- Graceful degradation: Reduce problem size or precision if needed

Numerical stability:
- Input validation: Check for valid ranges and special values
- Safe operations: Use numerically stable algorithms  
- Error detection: Monitor for NaN/Inf generation

STEP 3: Recovery Mechanisms
Memory exhaustion:
IF shared_memory_required > available_shared_memory:
    reduce tile sizes OR use streaming approach OR fallback to global memory

Numerical instability:
IF overflow_detected:
    use higher precision OR implement loss scaling OR clamp values

Invalid inputs:
IF invalid_parameter_detected:
    return error code OR use safe default values OR skip computation

STEP 4: Verification Integration
Runtime checks:
- Parameter validation at kernel entry
- Intermediate result validation in debug builds
- Post-computation result verification

Compile-time verification:
- Static resource usage analysis
- Numerical stability proof obligations
- Type safety verification

STEP 5: Fallback Strategies
Performance fallbacks:
- High-performance path with aggressive optimizations
- Medium-performance path with conservative optimizations  
- Safe fallback path with minimal assumptions

Implementation example:
```tessera
@kernel.multi_variant(
    variants=[
        ("high_perf", {"precision": "fp8", "tiles": "large"}),
        ("balanced", {"precision": "fp16", "tiles": "medium"}), 
        ("safe", {"precision": "fp32", "tiles": "small"})
    ]
)
def robust_gemm(A, B, C):
    # Implementation with automatic variant selection
    pass
```
```

## Integration with Automated Planning

- Update memory usage: 3 × 128 × 128 × 2 bytes = 98KB < 228KB ✓
- Update computation intensity: 2 × 128³ FLOPs per shared memory load
- Propagate to dependent decisions

STEP 4: Backtracking with Explanation  
IF memory_constraint_violated:
    BACKTRACK to tile size decision
    REASONING: Current tile size exceeds memory capacity
    TRY smaller tile sizes: 64×64, 96×96
    SELECT tile size with best performance that satisfies constraints

STEP 5: Solution Validation
Generated plan: [SELECT-ALGORITHM(flash-attention), 
                SET-TILE-SIZE(128,128),
                CHOOSE-PRECISION(bf16,fp32),
                OPTIMIZE-LAYOUT(swizzled)]

Validation reasoning:
- Memory usage: 98KB < 228KB ✓
- Throughput estimate: 1200 TFLOPS > 1000 ✓
